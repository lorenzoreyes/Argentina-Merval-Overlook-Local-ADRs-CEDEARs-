This works was aim at first to analyze relationships
between arngentinian local stocks paireds to their
respectives ADRs, so it would to be possible to get
the forex rate that the market was pricing the USD/ARS
during capital controls and use the ADR as a technichal
indicator to preview directions of local stocks

I made some changes and analyze the whole argentinian market,
obtaining the market returns measured in local currency,
in USD and to see the differences.

There are two Notebooks, one period mid 2018 to mid 2020 with 
intraday data of 60 minutes interval, and a second one of 10
years data.
You can observe the market return of local stocks, their respectives
ADRs, get forex rate "official" and market, and compare it to 
CEDEARs to see which decision is a better option for you.
(Note: in the 10Year Notebook the only CEDEAR with available data 
for that timeframe was AIG.BA)
